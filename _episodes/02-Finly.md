# Finly the Fish

As previously stated we will be introducing the idea of software design by interactivly walking through the design steps. In this module we will be following Finly the Fish, a new software developer who is put to work on a huge mess of a project.

Note: the presentation for Finly can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/@JamilGafur/intersect_SD#/ )

# Finly's Background

Finly the fish has been in a school for long enough and wants to start working on their own project. After applying and looking around Finly found a job as a software Designer for Ben the Bever. Ben has been working on building a Dam for his lake for past 5 years and it has become a bit of a mess. Ben hopes that with Finly on his team they can make a better codebase for the Dam!
