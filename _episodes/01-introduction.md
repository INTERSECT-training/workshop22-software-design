# Why Software Design?

From building a house, to managing personal finance or going on a road trip, everything needs planning. One a large scale, Software Design in planning for the ``life cycle`` of a codebase. Software has the possibility of being used for a long time, restructured, collaboativly intergrated and so much more! As a programmer our job is to learn and understand how to make our code as ``human efficient`` as possible.

# What is Software Design?

Software Design is a BIG Structure of many different things that essentially boils down to the following statement. ``This code is usable and correct``. While this statment is very simple, it packs alot of information. Mainly, what does it mean to be usable and correct? Well this involves working on making sure the code is tested, has appropriate hardware and a well defined enviorment, easily distributable, easy for new people to come in and work on and so much more!


# How does Software Design work?

The use of software design is based on a Software Development Cycle. This cycle follows the following steps of Communication -> Requirment Understanding and Gathering (RUG) -> Design -> Testing -> Programming -> CI/CD -> Communication.

Each of these sections are covered in different modules (see links) and there is no necessariry starting point. At a high level we can define each part of the section as follows:
    
    1. Communication: the users ask for what features, issues or concerns they want or the customer talks about the idea for their project
    2. RUG: The development team takes the information from the user and determins which problems to work on, as well as how feasibily the time frame is with respect to pay and resources available.
    3. Design: In this phase the development team creates a workflow for how the code can/should be run and who can work on what. 
    4. Testing: The team takes this design to the customer/user and their is a disucssion on what tests should be appropraite for the code.
    5. Programming: once all the fine details are ironed out the programming can begin
    6. CI/CD: After the code is passed the inital stage and passes the customer provided tests it needs to be intergrated into the original code base (Think of this as a software update)
    7. GOTO 1


In this module we will go over a developers progress as they walk through these stages
